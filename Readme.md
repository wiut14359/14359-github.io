	Poehali.Uz is a low-cost, experienced company with a dedicated team in tour. The company helps people to travel and explore the world. The company offers quite good services for its clients such as trekking, adventure, tour guide, camping and so on. Furthermore, this tour group provides with affordable packages for local and international travel.
	So far, they have had many clients and all of them have been satisfied with the service of the company.
	Since they did not have an official website until now, I decided to create a website for this experienced company.
	In order to create this site, I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript programming languages. I used some animations and a lot of photos for this website. It was a little bit difficult for me to make the index.html a home page because I made more animations than the other pages. 
	In addition, I added pages like about, book and package. For the website, I put the services offered by the company for travelling. I used photos for website from pinterest.com.
